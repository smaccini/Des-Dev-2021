    "- Import or collect tweets using a keyword or hashtag. Watch your rate limiting!\n",
    "- Use Pandas to sort and analyze your tweets.\n",
    "- Calculate user coordinates, where feasible, for the set of collected tweets. Again, watch your rate limiting!\n",
    "- Map the tweets using the calculated locations.\n",
    "- Use at least one data visualization from a previous exercise, demo, or the course text to analyze a different element of your tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a bonus challenge, try to map some other quality of your data. For instance, you might only map the locations where a certain word or hashtag is used, or try to visualize the quantity of tweets that share a location using a larger radius dot."
