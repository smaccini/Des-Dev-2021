      "The game is visually alright. However, it is quite horrible compared to other Animal Crossing games. Not only this, but the fact that it is marketed as relaxing throws me off. Animal Crossing is supposed to be fun, not relaxing. A very terrible title, and have got my refund two weeks ago.\n",
      "Don't trust the critics, they are false. I've seen critics with lower ratings than a 70. Overall, the game is disappointing and lacking. False advertising, updates are lackluster, and the game is unplayable. It's buggy as well. Some sprites wouldn't load until 30 seconds later. 0/10.\n",
      "I'm cool with the one island per console limitation, but its insane that progress in the game is restricted to what player one does. I recently started an island with my wife. What if my wife quits playing the game? Will I have to start over? Crazy.\n",
      "It’s a fun game, very reminiscent of the old Animal Crossing games. HOWEVER, the inability for users of the same switch to have different islands isn’t cool. In fact, only the first player on the switch can complete assignments from Tom Nook and other characters. Not even a second copy of the game will rectify this. The only way to rectify it is to buy another switch. Nintendo is being VERY GREEDY in limiting the game play like this. And for that reason, I give this game a 4.\n",
      "\"One Dictator, Seven Slaves\" same-console multiplayer is a huge disappointment.  We bought this game to *share* it- one island, one screen, shared decisions and contribution,\n",
      " My brother who is the Citizen Representative enjoys the game and it is really polished and has a nice gameplay loop, but I feel ripped off. To me, this game deserves nothing more than a 1 out of 10, because I really cannot live with the fact that my game is limited. If you pay €60 for a game, you want to fully enjoy it. Now I just can't because of these restrictions.\n",
      "My gf started playing before me. No option to create my own island and guys, being the 2nd player to start on a console SUCKS!!!! You miss out on so much that only the 1st player gets in terms of activities, resources, etc. It's absolutely terrible. You have to buy a 2nd console if more than one person in your household wants to get the full game experience. That's unacceptable.\n",
      "Only the first player created in the game can actually contribute to the development of the island and do the important stuff. The other players on the island can’t contribute and can only really gather resources. This limits every other player than the 1st one and really blows. I hope Nintendo fixes this.\n",
      "house and furniture. I hope nintendo can soon fix this big issue, because for now, this killed any intentions i had to play the game.\n",
      "Bought the game for my Girlfriend and me. The system that you can only have one island is absolutely **** Why Nintendo, why???? Destroyed so much fun for me..\n",
      "The one island per console is pretty stupid, but I really enjoy the game. Probably a much bigger issue for those with families or multiple users on the same Switch but for me it's not too much of a problem. Really great way to unwind, the Nook Miles are a little gimmicky but keep the game interesting for now. Kinda wish it wasn't locked to real time but mostly because I'm impatient. I can see myself logging a metric f-ton of time into this game. Good way to calm down after ripping and tearing through Hell in Doom Eternal.\n",
      "Congratulations Nintendo, you have officially become the worst video game company this year!\n",
      "If you do, there goes $60 down the drain. Only 1 island is allowed to be created per Switch, and if another player on the same Switch wants to play, they'll be a glorified visitor on the island, unable to make any decisions for the island, being restricted to do essentially nothing but build their own home. The game either needs to make the option of making multiple islands or give everyone on an island the option to be in control. My sister made an account first and unless I pay another $300 for a new Switch, I can't play the game. Such a disappointment, would rather have gotten DOOM.\n",
      "Through their failings, Nintendo has ruined what would have been an amazing experience for people to enjoy together. Unless you intend to play this game solo I suggest avoiding it.\n",
      "BEWARE!  If you have multiple people in your house that want to play this game they can not each have their own account (island).  ONLY ONE customizable island can be played per Switch.  Even if you buy two copies of the game you will still only be able to customize ONE island.  I have 3 kids that want to play this game and they each want to customize their own island - AND THEY CANT!   This is absolutely unacceptable.  Maybe the dumbest thing Nintendo has ever done.  I have owned every Nintendo console since the original NES and I can not think of a worse decision by Nintendo.\n",
      "The limitation of one island per Switch (not per cartridge, per Switch) is nonsensical. It‘s obvious Nintendo is just trying to sell more Switch consoles. This means only one person in your family can enjoy the game to its fullest extent. Player 2 can barely do anything, and their progression is blocked until player 1 progresses further. Player 2 can’t make any administrative decisions. Players 1 and 2 have to share limited daily resources. I had to delete my save so my brother could enjoy the game.Sorry but this is an instant 0/10. The Switch is a family-oriented console and this is not a family-oriented game. This is a colossal failure on Nintendo’s part.\n",
      " Nintendo needs to patch this, or else refund every person that isn't a single person household with this game.\n",
      "Only one island per console. The only way to get another is to buy another console I don’t mind buying another copy of the game but another console is too much. I’m leaving such a negative score in the hopes nintendo has a change of heart.\n",
      "We need equal values and opportunities for all players on the island! My wife is the first player, which is great but I do not want to wait for her progress. At the same time, I do not want her to have a a second class player experience if I am the founder. Fix this Nintendo!!\n",
      "I think it's a really enjoyable, addictive game. The graphics look really good, and doing chores for Tom Nook doesn't feel like it. The criticisms about one island per console are very valid, and understandably frustrating. I can see how families and couples would have a problem with it, though, even if it is something I do not. Just don't think that's worth giving it a zero. Anyways, buy at your own risk, but do your homework first\n",
      "As a secondary island member, it is hard to rate this game more than a 1. This is my first time playing an Animal Crossing game. My spouse played first, establishing himself as the island representative. I quickly realized that this meant I have no ability to make any decisions about the island. Thankfully my spouse asks for my input when placing houses, musuem, etc..  But then I realized he also gets access to diy recipes that I don't and that the island doesn't progress if he doesn't progress it. I can't contribute to the building off houses! We have no problems sharing resources. We have divided the island in half and have been sharing... But I feel like I'm getting a watered down version of the game. I don't think I should have to buy a whole other switch just so I cna have my own island! It seems ridiculous and unfair. I can't even imagine having a family with children who all want to play. How do you decide who gets to be the decision maker? I am sad because I love the game, but I feel disappointed that I don't get to experience it in full because I'm not the primary player.\n",
      "It's 2020 and for some reason Nintendo has decided that only one island is available per Switch console. Meaning my fiancé cannot progress the game beyond what I have done since I started my game first. She cannot place buildings down. She cannot obtain better tools until I've done it myself. Why is she hamstrung? She has to have a lesser experience because of it. This is an utter joke and I expect my money back. I'm being pushed into buying a new console just so she can have the full experience. I will NOT be buying a whole new console just for that. This is shameful.\n",
      "Having one island per console isn't even the worst part about this game. The fact that every other player - except the first person to boot up the game - cannot learn and perform more than 75% of the games functions is beyond UNACCEPTABLE. At this point Nintendo expects each switch console user to purchase their own switch with an additional animal crossing game if they want to play AC at the same register as the island \"resident representative\" LOL. This issue is clearly a money grabbing scheme and could easily be avoided by either 1) allowing everyone to be 'resident representative, or 2) Giving each player the OPTION to either join someone else's island on their switch OR create their own island. This function needs to be fixed as the game at this point is BROKEN, and is very disappointing for the following types of demographics: Couples who share a switch, siblings who share a switch, a parent and a child who want to play together, Roommates who all pitched in to buy a switch together.... you get my point. Hopefully it can be fixed because currently customers are very dissatisfied with the results.\n",
      "This is so annoying. Only one player has the ability to play this game because only one island. Nintendo doesn't deserve my money anymore.\n",
      " The game looks gorgeous, the character customisation is at a series high, the villagers seem more alive than ever before, the progression is satisfying (albeit slow in the first few days), and all in all, the game is just fantastic. I'll be playing it for years, for sure.\n",
      "I purchased this game for my household (me and my GF) and she started playing the game first. There was no advertisement or clear indication of this but each switch console is limited to one Island and the first person on that Island has a much better gaming experience than anyone else. Anyone else that joins the island cannot build and building, set any mandates, and cannot progress in the story (e.g. getting tools) until the owner of the island does. There are also restrictions on what the second player can put in the musuem. There is no reason for there not to be a second game file for each profile on the switch and Ninentdo attempt to push people to buy seperate consoles for this game is extremely greedy. Gameplay is actually great but the severe limitations and no forewarning leads me to post this review to tell people not to buy this game if more than one person will play on the switch.\n",
      "The game is probably fine but you can't fully experience it if you are the second player on the same console. You are forced to live on the island of the player who first started the game. Even worse, you share resources. So player one collects all fruits, insects etc. and you stand there with nothing. This has to be the worst game design decision ever made. Until that is fixed I cannot play and therefore not recommend the game. Shame on you Nintendo. Thats not family friendly at all.\n",
      "they heavily marketed this game as a social experience. a game to share with your friends and family. but heres the catch, you will need 1 nintendo switch for each player to get the full experience. I bought the game to share it with my girlfriend but the first player is considered as the FOUNDER of the island, and he is the one that will progress the story, that will unlock stuff and do all the cool things. The second nintendo switch profile will act merely as a villager, with little to no impact on the game and not able to progress without the founders progress. Game ruined by greed, want to have the full experience? BUY 2 PHYSICAL COPIES AND 2 NINTENDO SWITCHES, yeah thats what nintendo requires of you to play a social game if you want to be social.\n",
      "The game is awesome, but the limit of one island per console means that only one person in my family actually gets to enjoy the game in its entiretyEveryone else is limited in what they can do, and they all take a supporting role. Disappointed to be honest. The game would be perfect if each profile could choose between joining an existing island or creating their own. Unfortunately, this is the only way I can protest\n",
      "Nintendo made this game so that only one person per console can get the full experience and it disappointing to say the least.\n",
      "One island per console is a pretty terrible and greedy design choice by Nintendo. Whoever is first on the island gets the full game experience and everyone else is gimped and cannot progress or do the same things.\n",
      " I have two complaints with this new entry though. The first is the crafting mechanic. While scavenging for materials to build things ranging from tools to furniture is interesting initially, the novelty wears off quickly and it becomes a chore. This is especially evident with tools constantly breaking. The second complaint is the lack of cloud saving, giving me no current way to back up my save data.\n",
      "You can only create one island per switch and anyone else that joins the island literally cannot progress until the person who created it does. Greedy Nintendo at it again.\n",
      "Seriously, shame on you Nintendo!\n",
      "You can only have one island per Switch. If multiple people play on the same system, you’ll be tied to whoever started the first game’s island. Kinda kills any sort of independence.\n",
      "Why add local co op if you can only do one island and not have an option to split screen?\n",
      "Forcing there to only be 1 island per account completely ruins multiplayer for any family or residents that share a switch. The only way to enjoy this with your family is purchasing multiple switches, and that's completely ridiculous. There's no reason not to have the option of starting a new Island. Just shady business. The game is fun, unfortunately, not everyone who lives on the island will get to experience that.\n",
      "Though advertised as multiplayer most in game actions are unnecessarily locked to the first person that starts the game. The poor design decisions include, but are not limited to:1) There is no mechanical reason for only one person to be allowed to craft certain items. This not only applies to larger projects such bridges, but also smaller diy recipes are only gifted to the first player. 2) You canot travel to other islands or invite friends to your island while playing co-op. (Not only online functions but the in game deserted islands too.)3) Rather than create a co-op inventory system they opted to be lazy and limit it to the leader only. Other items are teleported to a shared inventory.4) Another minor issue with co-op is the controls for swapping tools changes depending on whether you're the leader or not. This is obviously a minor gripe, but annoying none the less. & completely  unnecessary.5) The most annoying thing about these issues is that they're the result of poor design choices and laziness.\n",
      "YES, the game starts slowly, but by day 3, I have had so much to do, I don't know what to do with all my time!  This is exactly the game the world needs right now.  Highly recommended, 10/10.\n",
      "Perfect for one player. Coop sucks, but what KILLS the game is that you can essentially only have one player PER SWITCH. Your SO/sibling/kid will have to play on YOUR island on YOUR profile.I cannot think of a single other home console game with this limitation. Not being able to share this with my family makes it a return.\n",
      "If more than one person plays on a Switch, even with seperate profiles you are forced to share not only the island but all the resources as well.  Anyone playing on a file after the first person to create a file is extremely limited as well.  It is an absolute nightmare to play with more than one person.\n",
      "Cant stop playing!\n",
      " IDK to it seems like Nintendo tried to make ppl buy more consols or sth. Disappointed.\n",
      "It's absolutely ridiculous that the 5 members of my family that all share a switch have to only have one island. And on top of that the first person is the boss. You have really let me down Nintendo and hope you get this fixed. Also how is there no cloud save??? Welcome to 2020\n",
      "I like many people and  across several platforms, share my switch with my partner. practically  Locking the game to one user per console is absolutely disgusting. That's all ther is to say.\n",
      "Updating my review - sharing a single island stinks, and I wish both of us in our house could have an island to place things where we wished, however my previous low review was a bit too harsh.  The additional islands make resource sharing easy, so at least both of us can play the game.  I really wish Nintendo would push out an update to allow saving 1 island per user account though ...\n",
      "It totally sucks that you can only have one island per switch. My boyfriend tried to make an island of his own.....BUT NO. So now he get to sit beside and just watch me play.Do it again and do it right Nintendo.\n",
      "It's absolutely amazing, gorgeous looking game, tons of stuff to do, you'll never run out of thing to do.\n",
      " I'll just let her play the game on her own and I'll play something else instead.\n",
      "This game is just further proof that Nintendo refuses to understand what people want from an online experience. Only one island, combined with whoever leads gets all the items picked up. Bottom line is if your not leading your not progressing.\n",
      "A good game, for sure, but only 1 Island. With this limitation, to keep the interest longer, only my wife play.Half the payer, half the rating. I Hope a change soon\n",
      "First of all I want to admit that yeah, it’s true single console multiplayer options are terrible. The second character gets dumbed down to a sort of follower that can only be in the shadow of the main player. Truth is tho that this feature has been true of New Leaf as well. If you wanted multiple villagers, the second wasn’t mayor and didn’t have as much freedom. So I would say that this isn’t a step back, but rather a lack of step forward from the developers on that front. However I don’t believe that this condemns all the amazing other features and steps forward. All furniture has been remodelled with great details, textures and lighting effects for a game with such a simplistic artistic direction. The museum is sublime, and the hourly music is memorable (for some). Animals now do lots of activities too and feel more alive than ever with witty and varied dialogue. Crafting is simple but well implemented, and it is a pleasure to slowly build the island into the little village the previous games had gotten us used to. I am ready to take off two points for the limitations created for families/friends with one console, though it does not concern me personally, but that does not entirely condemn it for all the wonderful things it has to offer and the great effort that was put into designing the game. It can’t be enjoyed by all, but for those that are planning to play solo, go for it, there is so much to get out of this experience!!\n",
      "Same-console multiplayer is severely limited. The game was designed so that only one person per family can actually get the full experience. Do NOT buy this game if you want to play with multiple people.\n",
      "The game is broken bugged right out the get go. I started a game,progressed my Island, etc. Later in the day, my wife gets on the family console to play, and is totally confused. The game only allows one person to play it on a console, the other profiles can only get a severely stripped down version of your island. No way to have their own profile. Some fanboys claim this was on purpose, but I cant imagine Nintendo would make this big of a mistake on purpose. Once this huge bug gets fixed, I'm happy to reevaluate the score, but this is a solid 0/10 for blocking other players from playing beyond the first to start a game on the console.\n",
      " I think the scores of ten are coming from people treating this as a sacred cow...\n",
      "Im Currently 18 hours in, with over 2 months worth of time skips. Game seems worse than its predecessors, Overall its a fun experience, but its limited in ways that i can only believe are to allow more copies to be sold before people can see the lack of content. Im on my 4th house expansion with a town of 6, shop upgraded. And it seems like im at the end of the museum collection. The little things that made the previous games feel special are missing, while new mechanics are in place to create a facade of advancement. Tons of things are missing from previous games that have become staples. Removal of the stat system for catches also removes half of the excitement of catching the same stuff over and over since you cant get a New best because size simply no longer exists. Controls could have been improved alot for this game, There are no touch functions despite having alot of use in many areas, such as home design and patterns or basic inventory management. Information is sparse. The game expects you to understand what your doing and why your doing it with zero direction for majority of the game. Honestly if this was any other game it would score much lower and i haven't even gotten into the multiplayer aspect both locally and online.\n",
      "Forced to play on same island as roommate who logs on first everyday.....I get minimal resources, and they get to decide every house and building location. WASTE OF MONEY.\n",
      " The games does everything right in term of the gameplay but it does have some cons to it as well. Nintendo have set restriction where you only can have one island on a switch which means that you can't have multiple islands on the same console. It also restricted other profile users in your switch to perform activities in the island if you're not the owner of the island. Therefore New Horizon single player aspect is fun and all but if you're looking for a co-op experience this game does really poorly on that aspect.\n",
      " I hope a patch fixes this\n",
      " At this point, while an okay but slow game, in the face of its price and the limitations its value drops far below far more mediocre games that are at least enjoyable more broadly.\n",
      "2 hours into the game and I got a house... that's all I feel like I accomplished. Games are supposed to bring some short of enjoyment, whether it be story, graphics or gameplay... This has none of that so far.... Just kill me now please.......\n",
      " The only negative is the one Island per console. If we could have even one per User I would have given this game a higher score.\n",
      "Alright game I guess, but it’s very lacking. I can’t give it a good rating due to the lack of content we get in updates. We got Rover on a cliff now. Rover used to be more memorable in the OG (Original GCN) game than a May Day Event. I am disappointed in this game. I didn’t give it a 0, because the storyline was good and should have continued. They could’ve made New Horizons a side-story game if it weren’t for three things. The NookPhone (and the whole “modernization” thing) and the sequel references, (because it would take place before them) and the most important thing: MORE STORYLINE! I know Animal Crossing  isn’t supposed to be a story mode game, but New Horizons feels like it’s supposed to be that way.\n",
      "I'm just not getting all of the hype with this game. I'm REALLY disappointed with this game. I expected to find some type of cool island with buildings and structures, as shown in commercials, but there's nothing there. It's misleading. I was told to play previous games. So, you what I did? I replaced the game. I said I wanted the 3DS version instead. They gave me the 3DS version and $30 credit. (since it cost only $30) I had a New Nintendo 2DS XL for games like Mario Kart 7, Super Mario 3DS (The 3D one, I have the 2D one, too), Miitopia, and Tomodachi Life. I like the Tomodachi Life game, and it was similar, so what the heck, I gave Animal Crossing 3DS a try. I do not regret it, and find it to be the BEST decision I ever made. They had BUILDINGS! It had LIFE! I enjoyed 3DS, 10 TIMES BETTER, in the FIRST DAY, than Animal Crossing Switch ever did, in THREE DAYS! I may do a review on Animal Crossing 3DS in the future, but it's too early to decide yet. Heck, many critics reviewed the game too early! Why count any of the critics before the release date? I would give Animal Crossing Switch a 1, but I can't. I did not have any fun, except for the airport thing, which the train thing was a huge improvement over the Switch version, so I can't even give it a 1. I will give it a 4/100 (0.4/10), because it was playable, at the beginning.\n",
      "There is a 75 character minimum for reviews. If your review contains spoilers, please check the Spoiler box. Please do not use ALL CAPS. There is no linking or other HTML allowed. Your review may be edited for content.\n",
      "I hate this game strongly, and I suggest people back away from this disgusting game.\n",
      "It's not a 0, by any means, but overall, WHAT KIND OF PLACE IS THIS! It makes you wanna get out, out of this trap of a game. It's not good. It has ruined last year, and this year. When we found out a New Animal Crossing game was coming out, we were excited. We each had humble hopes. Ever since that 2019 announcement, I was dreaming of an amazing town to play in. But, when the trailer for New Horizons came out, our hopes were not as high. We were debating whether to get the game. We all agreed that we didn't like the whole NookPhone thing, but we still had hopes. We were excited March, but slowly but surely, it became worse. When April came along, so did Bunny Day. UGH! That was STUPID and didn't make me want to play the game! I started getting bored around mid-April, slowly but surely decreasing my rating. May was alright, and then we realized how repetitive it was. My friend didn't appreciate the game as we wanted it to be. As the months went by, everyone, including me started to not like the game. It became a bad game. It became so repetitive, we couldn't even play a minute. It's a waste now. Some new features are alright, but I can't give this any more than a 3/10. It's not a 0, we kind of enjoyed the game at first. Even the updates couldn't save the game... The updates are horrible and repetitive. They don't fix the game, and never will. No matter how many updates they release, it will never fix the game. As a long time Animal Crossing fan, I am disappointed. Many long-time Animal Crossing fans are disappointed in this game. Even people who don't play Animal Crossing will eventually find New Horizons repetitive. Whatever the case, I suggest people do not get the game. You may find it alright for a few hours, but after that, prepare to be disappointed. If you want to be introduced to Animal Crossing, we suggest an older game, but not the spin-offs. I think this should represent the issues that people think of this game. Oh, and the hourly music. Oh my... it's bland. It does not represent Animal Crossing music, and feels extremely bland, especially in the first month. It makes you want to turn off the music entirely. That's another issue I forgot to mention. The music! I remember playing, and the music... is boring. Now I think that's everything to include in my opinions, along with my friends opinions. It's a disappointment.\n",
      "I was very excited for this game and when I got it I was hooked. But that feeling only lasted a few weeks and after that I put down the game and didn't pick it back up. Enjoyed it but thought the wonderful experience would last longer. Eventually you'll get bored.\n",
      " I was going to give this a 5 at first, but I'm just now realizing how much this game hates it's players. 4 it is.\n",
      "Animal Crossing in name and villagers only.  This game is missing so much and is so incomplete.  They sold it under the promise that there would be meaningful updates which they have failed to deliver on.  The only content updates were parts of the game that were not quite complete when the game released such as diving or the museum/ artwork, but it was obvious they were supposed to be in the game as people could glitch into the water to swim and the spot for Redd to show up was already there.  What the hell did they do with the extra six months they took after the first release date before actually releasing?  Meanwhile they add a few clothing/ furniture items every month and boldly call it a \"free update\".  Where's the coffee shop, shampoodle, fortune teller, GYROIDS FFS, store upgrades, shoe shop, gracies, mini games, etc etc etc.  If it wasn't severely time gated then the main story would have been done in a day if that.  What a rip off and blatant lie to their promise.  The only reason I gave it a 2 was I did enjoy what little of the game there was.  New Leaf was 10x the game. Pretty typical of Nintendo and their over-glorified mobile tablet now.\n",
      "Let me first start off saying I'm a huge AC fan. With that being said, wtf happen nintendo? It's been past a year now and their updates are pure garbage in comparison to what New Leaf provided.  The characters don't have any life to them, if you have more than one personality type prepare to read the same dialogue again and again. This is unavoidable dude to you being allowed 10 villagers max and there being only 8 personality types in the game. I'm really frustrated and confused as to why I'm paying for Nintendo online membership to utilize the games island backup service but if I ever wanna restore my island save I need to contact Nintendo support and have them hold my hand though the process. Long story short get the game play for a year or buy new leaf and have fun.\n",
      "Bought this game to relax and feel free.Bad choice. All the game you are in debt and tom nook take all the credit for the work you do.VERY basic and repetitive.The character will tell their intro lines EVERYTIME you talk to them. Grindy AF\n",
      "This shouldn’t be called New Horizons since there’s nothing good in this game. I don’t believe it. What is this garbage? It’s a time-waster, in a bad way. You get bored quickly. There’s only three songs in this game. THREE SONGS! The title theme, the outside theme, and the shopping tent theme. WHAT IS THIS? You get two villagers and they don’t help you with progress. I quit this game. I wanted to throw my controller into the TV and destroy the island! Luckily I got a refund, but it was a hassle!\n",
      "Initially, I could not put down this game. I spent two weeks after getting a \"4-star\" island rating trying to raise it to 5 but... I hate it now. I hate the way my island looks and feels. I look to other player's 5-star islands and it is not my jam. I've ruined so much of the natural beauty of my secluded island to please Isabelle, but she's never satisfied. Can't even start a fresh island without deleting all my progress. Do I really want to back to a time when I only had one outfit?\n",
      "It's a good game with beautiful graphics but it gets quite boring after some time and it just doesn't grip me as New Leaf did.\n",
      "This empty, life-less husk of a game is an insult to the name Animal Crossing. Out of hundreds of NPCs with rich, vibrant (and seemingly unending) dialogue, New Horizons gives us a handful who say something different a grand total of one time a day. How anyone who was a real animal crossing fan did not immediately storm this developer’s headquarters and spit on their placard is beyond my understanding. Go look at your town. It’s very pretty, fancy, and oh-so- Minecraft????  Customization is great but these NPCs (a large part of what made the older games so fun) have no soul. I’m sure marketing made a great pitch for online play and yadda-yadda but how no one brought up the fact that this game is primarily going to pique the attention of a niche audience who has been waiting for years and who did not go ga-ga for online play (mostly because it largely didn’t exist on this platform) is also baffling. I hope that future updates will fix this glaring issue but fear that even the most honed necromancy will not have the juice to bring our islands to life.\n",
      "I bought this game as a joint venture for me and and son, as it's been raved for its help against mental illness. My son turns out not to be interested in the game. He would sooner play Minecraft but he has start the world and is the king user.Myself and my wife are player two and three.. effectively visitors on our sons island. We can't progress in the game. Can't move forward with the story or anything it's like we're on a limited trial version of the game.. The only way round this apparently is to buy a second or third switch!  Which frankly is completely unacceptable! Nintendo and the animal crossing team need to fix this asap.\n",
      " This game is fine on its own but Animal Crossing has been separating the main theme it started from, which is “family, friendship and community.”\n",
      "My husband and I decided to get it, because we both love animal crossing. Since my husband bought it, he started first. He's been playing it a few days, and I went to start my island when he wasn't playing. Guess what? I can't. You LITERALLY CANNOT HAVE TWO ISLANDS ON ONE SWITCH. Are you kidding? Just because my husband started the game, now I can never have my own without spending hundreds of dollars on another game console? That is absolutely ridiculous. Now I will never be able to actually play the game, since he has already started the town and is now in charge of all the decisions. I am beyond furious.\n",
      " If you took your time to read this whole thing, I appreciate it a lot, even if you agree or not, I like this game a lot and have played 100 hours to this point but, is important to address its issues.\n",
      " This seems like a long list of complaints, but the good really does outweigh the bad!\n",
      "This game and what is behind it is honestly appalling. Of course there's the one-island-per-console thing, which is terrible, but the game itself is just not what the Animal Crossing series is supposed to represent. The villagers have been completely sidelined and now do nothing to contribute to the game, repeating the same happy-go-lucky lines over and over. What happened to the sass? The gossip? And what happened to being part of a community? Now the main focus is showing off your island, but the game can't even do that right because of the horrible quality of life, such as the aforementioned island limitation as well as every minute task taking forever to do. Post-launch support has been revolting, and a year later this game still lacks most of the content of the previous titles. The developers refuse to listen to any gripes players may have, and do the bare minimum to constitute the game being $60, because they don't have to care because of how well this game sold. If you like the Animal Crossing series please DO NOT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS GAME.\n",
      "No cooking/eating in a game like this? Horrendous. Animal Crossing: New Horizons sports a disappointing amount of content, absolutely unrepresentative of its steep price tag. Don't get me started with that one island per console and severe limitations on other users hogwash. I've never seen save files handled on any game as badly as this; not to mention this is a first-party title on a console, which makes it even worse.\n",
      "The customization is aight, but Nintendo needs to be held accountable for **** practices in this game. Less content than New Leaf, one island per Switch, and everything is so bland and dull after playing for a little bit\n",
      "The game has good graphics....that's all you can say about this \"game\". If you can call it \"game\"....The Villagers don't have any personality, The dialogues are repetitive, The Events are really boring and the Updates are empty and just not good. I have over 1000 hours in the game but only because i started a new Island everytime it got boring. We NEED gameplay new dialogues, more personality!!! NO New objects\n",
      "if i was writing this review a year ago this game would’ve been at a 9 or even 10 as i and a bunch of other fans were promised updates to the game that would add new features however a year later this game feels less like a 60$ game and more like an e3 demo, we’ve only gotten a handful of updates most of which were watered down features that were already in the base game of previous entries, lackluster “events” or random (tiny) furniture that no one has asked for we haven’t received a proper quality of life update or any major updates that added new or even old features except 2 both of which were last year meanwhile animal crossing pocket camp (a free mobile game) receives  updates way more frequently and almost each one includes exciting furniture sets, this game is an absolute let down from the high that was new leaf and it’s sad to see such a great series  produce such a boring  experience\n",
      "Why is there crafting in an Animal Crossing game? This isn't a Minecraft-style game! STOP STEALING FROM MINECRAFT NINTENDO! There are corporations now that are even more selfish than EA, including you Nintendo. This is the worst game ever made, and Nintendo should be embarrassed of themselves. It makes no difference to me whether it gets a Metacritic score of 90! That's a lie! Nintendo most likely paid them to choose only the positive reviews and one mixed review for the game. THAT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING REASONABLE! Customers complain about most games in a variety of ways, and the way Metacritic does that is unrealistic and does not make sense. Metacritic, please do your research! This game will always, and forever be a 0/10.\n",
      " To sum up: It's a pretty game with no soul and in the end, will bore the cr*p out of you.\n",
      " Overall rating: 25/40 => 6.25/10 => 6/10\n",
      "Lacking in content, frustrating menus, boring and bland villager dialogue, updates that add cut content from older games so it really isn’t new stuff\n",
      "While I understand why people like this game... it's just not for me. I just couldn't keep playing it, and I just ended up moving on to other games. To me there just wasn't a whole lot to do, and every time you thought you were doing something cool you would have to wait a day for it, and don't even get me started on the menuing... Honestly, my favorite part of the game was catching bugs and fish, and while I can see why people like this game, it was just boring to me. My advice: wait for a big sale, or even better, just buy Stardew Valley.\n",
      " 3) Outside of events, the game is pretty stale. The amount of villagers keeps things interesting but after a week you heard all of Isabelle's basic greetings. Your person says the same cringy line EVERY TIME you find a fossil, catch a fish, ect.\n",
      " Seriously, if you have a 3DS, buy New Leaf instead. It's better in basically every way and is significantly cheaper. Or just emulate the older ones\n",
      "this game SUCKS the whole game to me is boring im so bored when i play i try to get far but i cant without being bored I love new leaf and i was dissapointed when i played new horizons and i was glad to see that i can place stuff outside but the stuff is to expensive i cant get bells fast enough i don't see enough rare bugs and fish so i cant get enough then they added swimming but that boring i want to decorate that is my favorite thing to do but its to expensive as i said also crafting is useless like i never use it its also so annoying how it requires some stuff that is sometimes like 20 gold nuggets and sometimes like 5 stone i just hate the game\n",
      "This game is virtually an alpha version of what i'm sure they planed. Are the bones of a promissing game, but as any alpha, it can barely be considered as a game. Boring after the first hours, all the good critics this game recived are the resoult of Nintendo paying more atention to buy good reviews than to the developement itself. Sad to see how this beloved saga suffered such degeneration thanks to the new Nintendo politics, cheap companny, cheap game.\n",
      "The game lacks over half of features from previous releases and passes infinitesimal updates as actual content update. Lackluster and disappointing. Play New Leaf for a propper Animal Crossing.\n",
      "Well, the director of this entry is the director of Happy Home Designer. That is why game feels more like a HHD sequel than a new Animal Crossing entry.... I loved this franchise but they literally removed everything that made AC charming, for what?? For being able to terra-form and decorate my island? This game is supposed to be a life-simulator, not a decorating game :/ Big let down! Also they promised us 3 years of updates, the first updates were nice but then the updates turned into adding the festivals and 3 items... wow! If the current director will also be the director of the next game, I am going to say goodbye to this franchise.\n",
      " It's basically a seasonal item collection sim\n",
      "I spent close to $400 to be able to play this game and I feel as though I and all other Animal Crossing fans have been scammed . After years of waiting , Animal Crossing fans were excited to hear there was a new mainline Animal Crossing game coming which promised amazing new features for decorating and truly customizing the  exterior of your town . It was a bit suspicious that they only showed the beginning of the game in the promotional material and didn’t showcase any of the rest of the things that are present in every other Animal Crossing game once you progress past the beginning . But , people figured there was a good explanation for this and , of course , expected that the game would include all the features that all the other mainline Animal Crossing games have because those things are what makes a mainline animal crossing game a mainline animal crossing game and differentiate them from the spin off games which are missing those features . However , once the game launched and people played it for a few weeks it became clear all those things were completely absent from New Horizons and that New Horizons only featured about 1/4 of the content of a normal Animal Crossing main title . When the game released , Nintendo promised to continuously update it for a few years and , in the beginning , they did do some fairly significant updates . This lead people to believe that the missing features in the game would come in the future but it is clear now , after a year of playing and seeing the updates get fewer and further between , that the game is never going to update to the point it can be considered the mainline Animal Crossing game that they claimed it was . The game itself is more like Animal Crossing Happy Island Designer than a mainline Animal Crossing Game . If you think of it as an Animal Crossing spin-off game for decorating an island then it is actually fairly fun , although , a bit unnecessarily tedious . If they had advertised it truthfully like that fans would have been happy with the game . But , the deceit of calling it a main line game , knowing it would mislead their customers into spending money , and then stringing them along for a year before revealing their trickery so there is no hope of fans getting their money back is , frankly , unforgivable . I would not have paid $60 for this game let alone the $400 I had to pay to buy the game , a Switch , and Nintendo Online to be able to play it properly . And that’s another thing , on top of having much fewer items than previous games ( despite essentially being a decorating simulator ) , you are required to pay for Nintendo online and trade with other players to be able to get half of the items . They want you to trade with your friends but no one has enough friends who want to spend hundreds of hours trading on animal crossing to be able to get every item they want ( especially since there is nothing to do for entertainment when you connect online with friends like there was in past games ) which forces them to go online and meet up with sketchy strangers who often try to scam them because there is no mechanic in game to be able to trade online safely . It’s clear this was just another tactic to get people to spend more money on the game without regard to making an enjoyable gaming experience . That seems to be the overarching theme of this game . They wanted to scam millions of fans into buying New Horizons with false promises of a mainline Animal Crossing game when the reality was an unfinished cash-grab , scam people into buying a Nintendo Online subscription to be able to fully play said game , and scam people into buying a Switch so that they will buy more games for it from them in the future . Well , in the future , unless they decide to make it right and actually update the game to being a proper Animal Crossing mainline game , I will never buy a Nintendo game at release again and I will buy all my Switch games used so that I do not support this company .\n",
      "Another big minus: Every island has a fixed color palette on all items that come in different colors. Instead of collecting color-changing items, you are now forced to buy Nintendo Switch online and trade. This is a big turnoff for me. Say, if you want a basic item like a white streetlamp, but your island only offers rusty red ones, you won't be able to get it unless you trade with someone else. I think this is a horrible feature and takes away the freedom of decorating. This applies to around 60-70% of all available items.\n"
